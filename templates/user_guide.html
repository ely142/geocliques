            Cliques are the heart of your experience. Cliques = groups of people who share a common interest tied to
            specific places across the globe.
            Each clique member can add his own spot or insight, making it a collaborative experience.<br><br>
            <strong>To Join Existing Clique:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Tap the <strong>Feed</strong> button in the navigation bar.</li>
                <li>Use the Search Bar to look up cliques by name or by topics that interest you.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>To Create Your Own Clique:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to your Home Map.</li>
                <li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the bottom-right corner.</li>
                <li>Fill in the clique details like name, icon, and description.</li>
            </ul>
            Once you've joined or created cliques, they'll appear on your Feed Page, and their markers will be
            visible on your Home Map - based on your selected display preferences (more on that in the next step).
            {% elif step_num == 3 %}
            Your Home Map is your main dashboard to stay updated on clique activities, events, markers, and reviews - so
            it's worth setting it up just the way you like.<br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Map Controls:</strong> Use the + / - buttons in the top-left corner to zoom in or out and
                    explore different areas.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Quick Action Buttons (Bottom-Right Corner):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Map Layer Selector</strong> - Choose your preferred map style: standard, satellite,
                            terrain, etc, based on
                            what works best for you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cliques Filter</strong> - Choose which clique markers to display on the map at any
                            time, using any combination
                            that suits your preferences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create a Clique</strong> - Quickly start a new clique by clicking and filling out
                            the details.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Take control of your map to make it both useful and uniquely yours.
            {% elif step_num == 4 %}
            Mark special places and share them with the clique members:
            <ul>
                <li>Tap on the location you want to mark directly on your Home Map.</li>
                <li>Select the clique you would like to add this marker to.</li>
                <li>Fill in the details: name, description, and optionally your own review of the place.</li>
                <li>You can always edit your review later by tapping the marker and selecting the <strong>Edit
                        Review</strong> button.</li>
            </ul>
            Other clique members can also leave their own reviews and rate the place you shared, making it a
            collaborative experience.<br>
            <br>
            By clicking on a marker within a certain clique, you'll be able to view detailed information about the place
            you're interested in. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Average Rating:</strong> See the total average rating given to the place by members of your
                    clique.
                    what works best for you.</li>
                <li><strong>Member Reviews:</strong> Read reviews shared by other clique members about their experiences
                    at the location.
                    that suits your preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Upcoming Events:</strong> Discover any events related to the place (more on events in the
                    next step).
            </ul>
            {% elif step_num == 5 %}
            Events are a great way to keep your clique engaged - whether it's a meetup, party, or special occasion
            happening at a specific place marked in the clique. To add an event:
            <ul>
                <li>Tap the marker where you want the event to take place.</li>
                <li>Tap the <strong>add event</strong> button and fill in the event details: date, time and description.
                </li>
                <li>You can edit or delete the event anytime by tapping the <strong>Edit Event</strong> button next to
                    it.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Visual Indicators:</strong> Markers with events will appear in blue.
            If an event is happening within the next 3 days, the marker will also have a pulsing effect to help grab
            your
            attention.
            {% elif step_num == 6 %}
            In the navigation bar, tap the bell icon to open your notification panel. Here you'll find important
            updates, including:

                <li>Cliques join requests</li>
                <li>Invitations or approvals</li>
                <li>Alerts from cliques you're part of</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> When the <strong>bell icon</strong> turns yellow, it means you have new
            notifications waiting - don't forget to
            check them!
            {% elif step_num == 7 %}
            The Feed Page is your hub for tracking your cliques and discovering new ones.<br>
            Here's what you can do on the Feed page:
            <ul>
                <li>Get an instant overview of all your followed and created cliques.</li>
                <li>Stay updated with the latest posts and markers from cliques you follow.</li>
                <li>Discover new cliques with the search bar.</li>
